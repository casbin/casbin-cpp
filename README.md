## Supported models

1. [**ACL (Access Control List)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list)
2. **ACL with [superuser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser)**
3. **ACL without users**: especially useful for systems that don't have authentication or user log-ins.
3. **ACL without resources**: some scenarios may target for a type of resources instead of an individual resource by using permissions like ``write-article``, ``read-log``. It doesn't control the access to a specific article or log.
4. **[RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)**
5. **RBAC with resource roles**: both users and resources can have roles (or groups) at the same time.
6. **RBAC with domains/tenants**: users can have different role sets for different domains/tenants.
7. **[ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-Based_Access_Control)**: syntax sugar like ``resource.Owner`` can be used to get the attribute for a resource.
8. **[RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)**: supports paths like ``/res/*``, ``/res/:id`` and HTTP methods like ``GET``, ``POST``, ``PUT``, ``DELETE``.
9. **Deny-override**: both allow and deny authorizations are supported, deny overrides the allow.
10. **Priority**: the policy rules can be prioritized like firewall rules.

## How it works?

In Casbin, an access control model is abstracted into a CONF file based on the **PERM metamodel (Policy, Effect, Request, Matchers)**. So switching or upgrading the authorization mechanism for a project is just as simple as modifying a configuration. You can customize your own access control model by combining the available models. For example, you can get RBAC roles and ABAC attributes together inside one model and share one set of policy rules.

The most basic and simplest model in Casbin is ACL. ACL's model CONF is:

```ini
# Request definition
[request_definition]
r = sub, obj, act

# Policy definition
[policy_definition]
p = sub, obj, act

# Policy effect
[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

# Matchers
[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act

```

An example policy for ACL model is like:

```
p, alice, data1, read
p, bob, data2, write
```

It means:

- alice can read data1
- bob can write data2

## Features

What Casbin does:

1. enforce the policy in the classic ``{subject, object, action}`` form or a customized form as you defined, both allow and deny authorizations are supported.
2. handle the storage of the access control model and its policy.
3. manage the role-user mappings and role-role mappings (aka role hierarchy in RBAC).
4. support built-in superuser like ``root`` or ``administrator``. A superuser can do anything without explict permissions.
5. multiple built-in operators to support the rule matching. For example, ``keyMatch`` can map a resource key ``/foo/bar`` to the pattern ``/foo*``.

What Casbin does NOT do:

1. authentication (aka verify ``username`` and ``password`` when a user logs in)
2. manage the list of users or roles. I believe it's more convenient for the project itself to manage these entities. Users usually have their passwords, and Casbin is not designed as a password container. However, Casbin stores the user-role mapping for the RBAC scenario.

## Documentation

https://casbin.org/docs/en/overview

## Online editor

You can also use the online editor (https://casbin.org/editor/) to write your Casbin model and policy in your web browser. It provides functionality such as ``syntax highlighting`` and ``code completion``, just like an IDE for a programming language.

## Installation and Set-Up

### Build instructions for all platforms

(Assuming you have CMake v3.19 or later installed)

1. Clone/checkout to [`casbin/casbin-cpp:master`](https://github.com/EmperorYP7/casbin-cpp/tree/ctest-setup)
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/casbin/casbin-cpp.git
    ```

2. Open terminal/cmd in the root directory of the project:

    **Note:** On Windows, this command will also create Visual Studio project files in the `/build` directory.

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    ```

3. After the project is configured successfully, build it:

    ```bash
    cmake --build .
    ```

4. To install casbin library to your machine run:

    ```bash
    cmake --build . --target install
    ```

    - For **Windows**, this will install `casbin.lib` to `C:/Program Files/casbin-cpp/lib`
    and the headers to `C:/Program Files/casbin-cpp/include`.
    - For Unix based OS i.e. **Linux and macOS**, this will install `casbin.a` to `usr/local/lib` 
    and the headers to `usr/local/include`

5. (OPTIONAL) To run the tests, issue the following command from `/build`:

    ```bash
    ctest
    ```

## Get started

1. Add the include directory of the project to the PATH Environment variable.
    ```cpp
    #include <casbin/casbin.h>
    ```

2. New a Casbin enforcer with a model file and a policy file:

    ```cpp
    casbin::Enforcer e("./path/to/model.conf", "./path/to/policy.csv");
    ```

2. Add an enforcement hook into your code right before the access happens:

    ```cpp
    std::string sub = "alice"; // the user that wants to access a resource.
    std::string obj = "data1"; // the resource that is going to be accessed.
    std::string act = "read"; // the operation that the user performs on the resource.

    if(e.Enforce({ sub, obj, act })) {
        // permit alice to read data1
    } else {
        // deny the request, show an error
    }
    ```

3. Besides the static policy file, Casbin also provides API for permission management at run-time. For example, You can get all the roles assigned to a user as below:

    ```cpp
    std::vector<std::string> roles( e.GetImplicitRolesForUser(sub) );
    ```

## Policy management

Casbin provides two sets of APIs to manage permissions:

- [Management API](https://casbin.org/docs/en/management-api): the primitive API that provides full support for Casbin policy management.
- [RBAC API](https://casbin.org/docs/en/rbac-api): a more friendly API for RBAC. This API is a subset of Management API. The RBAC users could use this API to simplify the code.

We also provide a [web-based UI](https://casbin.org/docs/en/admin-portal) for model management and policy management:
